        "$${\\displaystyle \\left\\|\\textbf{w}\\right\\|_{p}=\\left(|w_{1}|^{p}+|w_{2}|^{p}+\\dotsb +|w_{n}|^{p}\\right)^{1/p}.}$$\n",
        " \n",
        "\n",
        "Let N = 2 such that our weight vector now exists in 2 dimensional space. \n",
        "\n",
        "Let p = 2 such that our weight vector's distance will be calculated in $L_{p=2}$ space \n",
        "\n",
        "In which case our general formula gets reduced from N-dimensions to 2-dimensions. So now we only need to consider a distance formula for a vector with 2 components, one for each dimension.\n",

        "\n",
        "You might be wondering about why the general case doesn't have differences for the components but the Euclidean Distance does explicitly show the component wise differences. It is common in mathematics to suppress certain information, especially if that information is \"obvious\" - however what is obvious is highly relative. \n",
        "\n",
        "The general formula assumes that the vector starts at the origin, in which case, there's no need to show the subtraction of zero from a vector component. \n",

The rule of thumb is don't build it if someone else already has because maintaining the code and fixing bugs is something that other developers (ie. the open-source community) can spend their time on and you don't have to. But if an open source solution doesn't exist for a solution that you need, then you'll need to build it or try an alternative solution.\n",
