        ">**When the dataset has two (or more) correlated features, then from the point of view of the model, any of these correlated features can be used as the predictor, with no concrete preference of one over the others.** But once one of them is used, the importance of others is significantly reduced since effectively the impurity they can remove is already removed by the first feature. As a consequence, they will have a lower reported importance. This is not an issue when we want to use feature selection to reduce overfitting, since it makes sense to remove features that are mostly duplicated by other features. But when interpreting the data, it can lead to the incorrect conclusion that one of the variables is a strong predictor while the others in the same group are unimportant, while actually they are very close in terms of their relationship with the response variable. — [Selecting good features – Part III: random forests](https://blog.datadive.net/selecting-good-features-part-iii-random-forests/) \n",

So instead of removing a feature we can replace it with random noise - feature column is still there, but it no longer contains useful information. This method works if noise is drawn from the same distribution as original feature values (as otherwise estimator may fail). The simplest way to get such noise is to shuffle values for a feature, i.e. use other examples’ feature values - this is how permutation importance is computed.\n",

        ">Recall that bagging involves creating multiple copies of the original training data set using the bootstrap, fitting a separate decision tree to each copy, and then combining all of the trees in order to create a single predictive model.\n",

        ">**Boosting works in a similar way, except that the trees are grown _sequentially_: each tree is grown using information from previously grown trees.**\n",
        ">\n",
        ">Unlike fitting a single large decision tree to the data, which amounts to _fitting the data hard_ and potentially overfitting, the boosting approach instead _learns slowly._ Given the current model, we fit a decision tree to the residuals from the model.\n",
        ">\n",
        ">We then add this new decision tree into the fitted function in order to update the residuals. Each of these trees can be rather small, with just a few terminal nodes. **By fitting small trees to the residuals, we slowly improve fˆ in areas where it does not perform well.**\n",

        ">Note that in boosting, unlike in bagging, the construction of each tree depends strongly on the trees that have already been grown."
