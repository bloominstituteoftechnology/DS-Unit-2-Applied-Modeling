For instance, “Which news story is the most interesting to this reader?” appears to ask for a category—a single item from the list of news stories.

This is especially helpful when an example can belong part A and part B, or have a chance of going either way.

    "> Lending Club is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform. Lending Club enables borrowers to create unsecured personal loans between \\$1,000 and \\$40,000. The standard loan period is three years. Investors can search and browse the loan listings on Lending Club website and select loans that they want to invest in based on the information supplied about the borrower, amount of loan, loan grade, and loan purpose. Investors make money from interest. Lending Club makes money by charging borrowers an origination fee and investors a service fee.\n",

    "Here's a fun demo you can explore! The next code cells do five things:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Generate data\n",
    "\n",
    "We use scikit-learn's [make_classification](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_classification.html) function to generate fake data for a binary classification problem, based on several parameters, including:\n",
    "- Number of samples\n",
    "- Weights, meaning \"the proportions of samples assigned to each class.\"\n",
    "- Class separation: \"Larger values spread out the clusters/classes and make the classification task easier.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "(We are generating fake data so it is easy to visualize.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Split data\n",
    "\n",
    "We split the data three ways, into train, validation, and test sets. (For this toy example, it's not really necessary to do a three-way split. A two-way split, or even no split, would be ok. But I'm trying to demonstrate good habits, even in toy examples, to avoid confusion.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Fit model\n",
    "\n",
    "We use scikit-learn to fit a [Logistic Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) on the training data.\n",

    "\n",
    "> Weights associated with classes in the form `{class_label: weight}`. If not given, all classes are supposed to have weight one.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The “balanced” mode uses the values of y to automatically adjust weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data as `n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y))`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Evaluate model\n",
    "\n",
    "We use our Logistic Regression model, which was fit on the training data, to generate predictions for the validation data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we print [scikit-learn's Classification Report](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#classification-report), with many metrics, and also the accuracy score. We are comparing the correct labels to the Logistic Regression's predicted labels, for the validation set. \n",
