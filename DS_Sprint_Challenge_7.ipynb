        "I believe the column that would hurt the model in the real world is the \"Risk\" column. The problem with this column is that it implies that the inspectors have prior insight into the cleanliness of the restaurant, while the purpose of the model is to predict the cleanliness of the restaurant (whether they pass the test or not). I had a similar problem in my Unit 2 Build project. I was building a model to test whether car accidents would result in major injury or fatality (Y/N), and a series of attributes counting the number of fatalities/major injuries/minor injuries per pedestrian/cyclist/driver leaked into my model, giving me a ver accruate model that was useless because the most important feature could not be retrieved prior to real world accidents."
